## during work

### The hackmd

 https://hackmd.io/FgI_WOrVQEaPoGi4mkmC4w

This is the template from https://github.com/codrkai/ReactJS_with_backend_and_frontend
and we will use it for the rest of our final project.

Remember to use the npm install in both frontend and backend.

```javascript
cd backend
npm start

cd frontend
npm start
```

if you want to do it simultaneously,you can run the following

```javascript
cd backend
npm run project
```

In backend, since we use python child_process, mind that python module **sentence_transformers** is required.

Please use **python 3.9**, other version may have problem.

For sentence_transformers installation, refer to https://www.sbert.net/#installation

## after work

Commit the changes to **your branches**, do not upload the corresponding changes to main branch or master branch unless authorized

Meanwhile, keep track of the changes may be useful, some gui such as sourcetree will work a lot.
